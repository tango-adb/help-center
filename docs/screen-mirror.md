# Screen Mirror

Screen mirror page allows you to see the device screen in real time, and control the device using mouse and keyboard.

## Video

### Create virtual display

On Android 11 or higher, Tango can create a virtual display and mirror it instead. The virtual display can run apps and accept inputs independently from the main display, allowing you to use multiple apps at the same time.

To mirror a virtual display, scroll to **Video** section, then select **Virtual Extended Display (Experimental)** in **Source** dropdown.  You can also customize the resolution and density of the virtual display below.

### Mirror camera

On Android 12 or higher, Tango can mirror the camera instead, so you don't need to open the camera app, and there will be no camera UI on the screen.

By default, Tango will mirror the camera at the highest resolution and frame rate. If the video is laggy or the device is overheating, you can reduce the resolution via **Limit Resolution** option.

To mirror a camera, scroll to **Video** section, then select **Camera (Experimental)** in **Source** dropdown. You can also choose front or back camera below.

### Use H.265 codec

On supported device and browser, use H.265 codec can improve video quality and reduce latency.

If your device supports H.265 encoding and your browser supports H.265 decoding, the **H.265** option will be available in **Video** section's **Codec** dropdown.

### Reduce resolution and frame rate

If your device or computer is not powerful enough, reducing resolution and frame rate can improve performance and prevent device from overheating.

In **Video** section, check **Limit Resolution** and **Limit FPS** to enable them. The **Max Resolution** option limits the resolution by its longer side while keeping the aspect ratio. For example, if device resolution is 1920x1080, and **Max Resolution** is set to 720, the resolution will be limited to 1280x720. The **Max FPS** option limits the frame rate.

## Audio

On Android 11 or higher, Tango can forward audio from the device to your computer. There are two options:

### Play internal audio on ...

Forwards internal audio (from apps) to computer. It has three values:

* **Device**: Disable audio forwarding. Internal audio is played on the device normally.
* **Tango**: Forward internal audio to computer.
* **Both**: Play internal audio on both device and computer.

Due to Android system restrictions, internal audio forwarding doesn't work if a wired or Bluetooth headset is connected. Also, notifications, alarms, and phone ringtone can't be forwarded and will always play only on the device.

When choosing **Both**, Tango will play captured audio through notification channel, so the volume is controlled both by the **Media** volume and **Notification** volume. If the sound on device is too quiet, try increasing both volumes.

### Forward microphone

Captures device microphone input and play it on computer.

Internal audio forwarding and microphone forwarding can be enabled at the same time.

## Control

### Mouse

The mouse inputs are translated to touch events on the device. You can use mouse to tap, drag, scroll, and zoom.

Some apps (like Chrome for Android) can also responds to right clicks and mouse wheel, but most apps are only designed for touch input, so all buttons behave like left click.

### Keyboard

The keyboard inputs are sent to the device as is. Except:

* When in full screen mode, some system-critical keys and shortcuts are handled by local OS and not forwarded to the device, for example:
  * **Command + Tab** on macOS: Switch between windows.
  * **Command + Q** on macOS: Quit the current app.
  * **Windows + L** on Windows: Lock the computer.
  * **Control + Alt + Delete** on Windows: Open task manager.
* When not in full screen mode, in additional to the above keys, more keys and shortcuts will be handled by local OS or Web browser, for example:
  * **Windows** key on Windows: Open Start menu.
  * **Ctrl/Command + W**: Close current tab.
  * **Ctrl/Command + N**: Open new browser window.

The **Windows/Command/Super** key becomes the Search key on Android (also known as the OS key in some ROMs). To see a list of supported shortcuts, press **Search + /** on the device.

### Simulate physical keyboard

By default, Tango uses Android's built-in virtual keyboard for sending keyboard inputs. When enabled from the **Control** section, Tango can also simulate a physical keyboard, which has the following advantages:

* The on-screen virtual keyboard won't show up when you type. This gives you more screen space, but also means you can't type on the device directly.
* The keyboard layout is configurable at **Settings → System → Languages and input → Physical keyboard**. You can choose a layout that matches your physical keyboard.
* It's more compatible with apps that don't respond to virtual keyboard inputs, including some IMEs and games.

### Touch

If your computer (or tablet) has a touch screen, you can use it to control the device. The touch inputs are sent to the device as is. Multi-touch is also supported.

### Game controller

Game controllers connected to the computer can be used to control the device. The controller inputs are sent to the device as is. It should work in games that support game controllers natively, like Minecraft, and emulators like PPSSPP.

### App switcher

On the left side of the screen there is the app switcher. It lists all running apps on the current display (either physical or virtual). You can tap an app to quickly switch to it.

## Troubleshooting

### The screen is black on lock screen or Netflix

For privacy, security or copyright protection reasons, apps can prevent screen to be captured. This will result in a black screen in Tango, and there is nothing we can do.

While you can't see the screen content, you can still control the device using mouse and keyboard. For example, you can use keyboard to enter the PIN to unlock the device.

### Can't control XiaoMi devices

In developer options, XiaoMi devices have a **USB debugging (Security settings)** option. It needs to be enabled for controlling the device.

## Tricks

### Show PowerPoint presentation on virtual displays

Some apps, like Microsoft Office, can display different content on multiple displays. For example, if Tango is mirroring a virtual display, start a PowerPoint presentation will show the presentation at full screen on the virtual display, while the main display shows the presentation controls.

If the app launcher is showing on the virtual display and covers the presentation, you can tap **Back** button in the command bar to close it.

### Create multiple virtual displays

On computers, you can open the device in multiple Tango tabs. Each time screen mirror starts, it creates a new virtual display. Android apps don't support running on multiple virtual displays, but you can run different apps on each of them.
