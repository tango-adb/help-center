# Enable USB Debugging

Android's USB debugging feature is for developers to debug and test their apps, but it can also be used to retrieve information from the device and control it.

By default, USB debugging option is hidden in Android settings. Depending on the device, the steps to enable it may be slightly different. Here are the common steps:

1. Open Settings app.
2. Find the **Build number** option. On some devices it may have a different name. The following table lists the location of this option on some devices:

  | Device                   | Location                                                      |
  | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Stock Android            | Settings > About phone > Build number                         |
  | Samsung OneUI            | Settings > About phone > Software information > Build number  |
  | Xiaomi MIUI 13 or higher | Settings > My device > Detailed info and specs > MIUI version |

  | Huawei EMUI              | Settings > About phone > Build number                         |
