# Enable USB Debugging

Android's USB debugging feature is for developers to debug and test their apps, but it can also be used to retrieve information from the device and control it.

By default, USB debugging option is hidden in Android settings. Depending on the device, the steps to enable it may be slightly different. Here are the common steps:

1. Open Settings app.
2. Find the **Build number** option. On some devices it may have a different name.
3. Tap the above option 7 times. You will see a popup saying "You are now a developer!".
4. Go back to Settings and find **Developer options**.
5. Tap **Developer options** and enable it on the top right corner.
6. Scroll down to find **USB debugging** and enable it.

Check the [guide](https://app.tangoapp.dev/guide) page for option names on different devices.
