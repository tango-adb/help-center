# Introduction

[Tango](https://tangoapp.dev) is a Web app for controlling Android devices. It's built on the open-sourced [Tango library](https://github.com/yume-chan/ya-webadb).

Tango works on latest versions of Chromium-based browsers, including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Opera. It also works on Android versions of those browsers, but not on iOS devices.

## Data security

Tango works entirely in your browser. All data is transferred directly between your device and your browser. Besides of some anonymous analytics data, Tango doesn't send any data to the server.

After first loading the page, Tango can work offline. You can disconnect from the Internet and continue using Tango.

## Quick Start

1. [Enable Developer options and USB debugging](./prepare.mdx) on the device you want to control.
2. Connect the device to your computer using a USB cable. For running Tango on Android, use a C-to-C or OTG cable, Tango can't control the device from itself.
3. Open [Tango](https://tangoapp.dev) in a supported browser on your computer.
4. Follow on-screen instructions to pair the device. If the device is not detected, make sure you have enabled USB debugging and connected the device to your computer.
5. The first time you connect to a device, you will be asked to authorize the connection on the device. Follow the instructions on the device.

Having issues while connecting? See [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.mdx).
