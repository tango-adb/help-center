# Screen Mirror

Screen mirror page allows you to see the device screen in real time, and control the device using mouse and keyboard.

Check the left navigation for more information on how to control the device, create virtual displays, mirror cameras, and troubleshoot common issues.

## Video

* **Source**: Choose the source of the video. It can be the device screen, a [virtual display](./virtual.mdx), or a [camera](./camera.mdx). Depending on the source, different options are available.
* **Codec**: On supported device and browser, use H.265 codec can improve video quality and reduce latency. If the device or the browser doesn't support H.265, the option will be disabled.
* **Encoder**: Choose the video encoder. **Default** will automatically choose the best encoder based on the device and browser. Some devices may ship with a buggy encoder, in which case you can try another one.
* **Bitrate**: The video bitrate in bps. Higher bitrate means better video quality, but also higher resource usage and latency. If the video is laggy, try reducing the bitrate.
* **Resolution**: The video resolution. Higher resolution means better video quality, but also higher resource usage and latency. If the video is laggy, try reducing the resolution.

## Audio

On Android 11 or higher, Tango can forward audio from the device to your computer. There are two options:

### Play internal audio on ...

Forwards internal audio (from apps) to computer. It has three values:

* **Device**: Disable audio forwarding. Internal audio is played on the device normally.
* **Tango**: Forward internal audio to computer.
* **Both**: Play internal audio on both device and computer.

Due to Android system restrictions, internal audio forwarding doesn't work when a wired or Bluetooth headset is connected. Also, notifications, alarms, and phone ringtone can't be forwarded and will always play only on the device.

When choosing **Both**, Tango will play captured audio through notification channel, so the volume is controlled both by the **Media** volume and **Notification** volume. If the sound on device is too quiet, try increasing both volumes.

### Forward microphone

Captures device microphone input and play it on computer.

Internal audio forwarding and microphone forwarding can be enabled at the same time.
