# App Manager

App manager lists installed apps on device.

## App Types

The app type filter has 3 options:

* **System apps**: apps that are pre-installed on the device and can't be uninstalled.
* **Third-party apps**: apps that are installed by the user.
* **All apps**: both system apps and third-party apps.

## Install APK

If you have an APK file on your computer, you can install it on the device by clicking the **Install APK** button.

Multi-part bundles are not supported. This includes `.apks`, `.xapk` and `.apkm` files.

## Command bar

The command bar has the following buttons:

* **Uninstall**: uninstall the selected apps. It's disabled for system apps.
* **Backup**: create a backup of the selected apps. App Backup is a deprecated feature, and most apps can't be backed up. For apps that allow backup, the backup file will contain the app's data, settings, and optionally the APK file.
* **Details**: show details of the selected app. This contains a breakdown of the app's storage usage.
