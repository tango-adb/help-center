# App Manager

App manager lists installed apps on device.

## Filters

There are several filters to help you find the app you want:

* **System App**: show only system apps or third-party apps. System apps are the apps that come with the device and can't be uninstalled.
* **Can be launched**: whether the app has a main activity that can be launched. Apps that can be launched are usually the ones you can see on your home screen or app drawer.
* **Can be backed up**: whether the app supports the legacy backup feature. Most apps don't support backup, and this filter is only useful for a few apps.
* **Split APK**: whether the app uses split APKs. This will affect the behavior of the **Export APK** function.

Each filter has three options:

* **Not Matter**: the filter is not applied. All apps will be shown.
* **Yes**: only apps that match the filter will be shown.
* **No**: only apps that don't match the filter will be shown.

If multiple filters are in **Yes** or **No** state, only apps that match (or not match) all filters will be shown.

## Install APK

If you have an APK file on your computer, you can install it on the device by clicking the **Install APK** button.

It can also install split APKs, including `.apks`, `.xapk`, and `.apkm` files.

## Command bar

The command bar has the following buttons:

* **Uninstall**: uninstall the selected apps. It's disabled for system apps.
* **Backup**: create a backup of the selected apps. App Backup is a deprecated feature, and most apps can't be backed up. For apps that allow backup, the backup file will contain the app's data, settings, and optionally the APK file.
* **Export APK**: export the APK file of the selected apps. The APK file can be installed on other devices. If the app uses split APKs, the exported file will be a `.apks` file including all installed features.
* **Details**: show details of the selected app. Including a breakdown of the app's storage usage.
