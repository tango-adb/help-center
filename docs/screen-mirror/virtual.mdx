# Create and mirror virtual display

import Pro from './_pro.tsx';

<Pro/>

On Android 11 and higher, Tango can create and mirror a virtual display. Virtual displays are similar to connecting multiple displays to the device. It can run apps and accept inputs independently from the main display, allowing you to use multiple apps at the same time.

To mirror a virtual display, scroll to **Video** section, then change **Source** to **Virtual**.  You can also customize the resolution and density of the virtual display below.

## Show PowerPoint presentation on virtual displays

Some apps, like Microsoft Office, can display different content on multiple displays. For example, if Tango is mirroring a virtual display, start a PowerPoint presentation will show the presentation at full screen on the virtual display, while the main display shows the presentation controls.

If the app launcher is showing on the virtual display and covers the presentation, you can tap **Back** button in the command bar to close it.

## Create multiple virtual displays

On Desktop platforms, by opening multiple tabs of Tango, multiple virtual displays can be created and mirrored in each tab. Each virtual display is independent and can run different apps. Note that Android apps can't run on multiple virtual displays, but you can run different apps on each of them.
