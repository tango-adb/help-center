# Create team

Team plan offers automatic device sharing across all team members. To create a team, follow the steps below:

## Open create team dialog

After logging into your account, you can find the **Create team** options on varies places including:

* The [**Pricing** page](https://app.tangoapp.dev/pricing)
* The profile menu by tapping your profile icon on the top right corner

If you already have the Pro plan, then you can't create a team. You must wait for your Pro plan to end.

## Invite members

In the **add team members** dialog, you can enter the email address you want to add to the team.

If the email address is already associated with a user on Tango:

* If the user already have Pro plan, or if the user is already in a team, then you can't add them to your team.
* Otherwise, you will see the user's name, and you can add them to your team.

If the email address is not associated with any user on Tango:

* You can add this email address to your team, and when a user sign in with this email address, they will automatically join to your team.

## Set member permission

* Member: can use all team devices and share their devices to team
* Manager: all permissions of member, and can add or remove members for the team

## Choose billing options

You can change between paying monthly or annually. There will be a discount for paying annually.

You can see the provisional pricing for your team based on the member count and billing options.
