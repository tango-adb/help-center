# Rule of payments

## Automatic payments

We will try to charge your saved payment method after the **Next billing** time noted in your settings menu.

## Failed payment

If the charge fails, we will retry in 3 (three) days, and your team can be used normally during the time.

If the second charge after 3 days still fails, we will not retry again, and your team will be suspended.

You can [update your payment info](./change-payment-info.mdx) and let us retry.

## Invoice

You can find the invoice for your payments (when charging a card added by you, no matter which team) in the **Invoices** section of user settings.
