# Version 1.6: Link Sign-in Methods

Today we are releasing version 1.6.0 which allows you to sign into your account with multiple methods.

{/* truncate */}

## Background

Today, you can sign into your Tango account through your Google, Microsoft, GitHub, or Alipay accounts. Using established account providers can help you sign in faster, more easily, and more securely.

However, each sign-in method creates separate Tango accounts.

## Link Sign-in Methods

In today's version, we have added a new feature that allows you to sign into your Tango account with multiple sign-in methods.

Here's how to use it:

1. After signing in, open **Settings** dialog from the profile menu on the top right corner.
2. Scroll down to the **Sign in** section.
3. Here you can see your current sign-in methods.
4. Click the **Connect** button, and sign in with the method you want.

From next time, sign in using both methods will log you in to the same account.

## Warning on connect to existing account

If you already have multiple Tango accounts via multiple sign-in methods, you can still connect those sign-in methods to one Tango account. But to be aware, you will lose the access to the other accounts.

For example, if you have one account via Google and another via GitHub, you sign in via Google, connect to GitHub, and then sign in via GitHub again, you will sign into the first account. Even if you disconnect GitHub later, sign in via GitHub will create a new account, the original account associated with your GitHub account has been permanently deleted.

Due to this risk, you can't connect to a sign-in method if that method already associates to an account with Pro plan.

## Disconnect Sign-in Methods

Similarly, you can disconnect any sign-in methods from the **Settings** dialog, except for the method you are currently using, so you won't lose access to the account.

## End note

Because of the changes required for this feature, some features might temporarily not work as expected until you update to this version (1.6.0). Also, you might need to sign in again after updating.
